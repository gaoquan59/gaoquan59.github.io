I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) at the School of Geography and Planning, SYSU. As a cultural geographer and urban studies scholar, I'm specialize in migration, religion, and their implications for social policy. I have published over 40 papers in prestigious journals such as China Quarterly, Dialogues in Human Geography, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, Social & Cultural Geography, and Geoforum.

I recieved my Ph.D. in Human Geography at Newcastle University in 2020. I completed my B.A. (2015) in Geography at South China Normal University.

My recent research focuses on the socio-cultural embeddedness of highly skilled international migrants in China. In 2023, I was selected for the Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by the Chinese Association of Science and Technology (CAST), becoming the first cultural geographer to receive this award. I also serve as the General Secretary (秘书长) of the Working Committee on International Exchange and Collaboration, the Geographical Society of China, and as the associate editor of the journal Transactions on Space, Place, and Culture.
